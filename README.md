# Professor-Rating-Class
Project for C# Class

Project Instructions:

Write a program that utilizes a ProfessorRating class. A professor has a first name, last name,
university, easiness grade, and a helpfulness grade. Grades range from 0 to 5.
The ProfessorRating class must have two constructors. One that allows instantiation of an object
with just first name, last name and university. It will assign a default of 3 for the grades. The
second constructor allows instantiation using first name, last name, university and the two
grades.
The ProfessorRating class must not allow a first name or last name to be changed after
instantiation.
The university should be examined or changed using only a property.
The grades should both have accessor and mutator methods.
The ProfessorRating class should have a display method that shows all attributes in an
appropriate format.
The ProfessorRating should have a ToString() method and the Main() method should
demonstrate that it works properly.
